A code base created by two programmers who, at the the time of writing, have one month of experience writing JS, is not very pretty or organized. We pruned out our git tree and filled out the crucial repository files.

Get<sup>1</sup> started
-------------------------------
Clone the repository, and...
```
npm install
```

<sup>1</sup> Because this is a RESTful API that can GET data...get it?

Debugging commands
----------------------
`npm start` local serve at localhost:3000

`npm test` runs unit tests with Karma
